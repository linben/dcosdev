# dcosdev

The *dcosdev* cli provides the one convenient entrypoint for developing operator services ([sdk services](https://mesosphere.github.io/dcos-commons/developer-guide/)) or basic service (marathon services).


Start with cloning the `dcosdev` repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/dcosdev.git
cd dcosdev
```


## setup the asset repository

`dcosdev` uses `minio` as its asset repository.

Use the following two commands to install the `minio` service and to make it available via the dc/os public agent.

```
dcos package install minio --yes
```

In your browser enter the following address.
```
http://<public-agent-ip>:9000
```


The `minio` credentials are minio / minio123.

Create a bucket named *artifacts* and set its policy to *Read*.


## install

**Note:** Currently `dcosdev` has only been tested with python2 !

Install the `dcosdev` cli using the following command, or if you don't want to mess around with the python environment on your local machine then build a docker image as described in the next step.
```
pip install .
```

The following command builds a docker image that includes `dcosdev` and the `dcoscli`.
```
docker build --no-cache -f misc/Dockerfile -t mydcosdev .
```

## developer guide

In your workspace create a project folder for your new service.
```
mkdir myservice
cd myservice
```

If you chosen to build the docker image in the previous step then you use the following commands before using `dcosdev`.
```
docker run -ti --rm -e PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd) -v $(pwd):/myservice -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock mydcosdev bash
cd /myservice
```

**Note:** All `dcosdev` cli commands have to run from the root of your project folder.

Here the help output for `dcosdev`.
```
dcosdev -h

  dcosdev --version

Options:
  -h --help                   Show this screen.
  --version                   Show version.
  --universe=<universe>       Path to a clone of https://github.com/mesosphere/universe (or universe fork)
  --dcos-username=<username>  dc/os username [default: bootstrapuser]
  --dcos-password=<password>  dc/os password [default: deleteme]
```

Before you continue make sure you have the *MINIO_HOST* environment variable set.
```
export MINIO_HOST=<public-agent-ip>
```

`dcosdev` gives you the choice to create an operator services (sdk services) or basic services (marathon services).


### operator services, aka sdk service

#### dcosdev operator new

Creating a new operator service.
```
dcosdev operator new myservice 0.42.1
```

Your myservice project will now have the following folder file structure.
```
myservice
 |- svc.yml
 |- universe
     |- package.json
     |- marathon.json.mustache
     |- config.json
     |- resource.json
```

#### configuration templates

If you use configuration templates in the svc then they live in the same folder as the svc.yml file.
```
myservice
 |- svc.yml
 |- myconfiguration.yml
 |- universe
     |- package.json
     |- marathon.json.mustache
     |- config.json
     |- resource.json
```

`dcosdev up` will also upload the templates to the asset repository. You will have to configure the uri to the template in the *resource.json* file, and have a fetch statement in the *marathon.json.mustache*.

#### custom scheduler

Use the following command to add gradle and java resources to your project for custom scheduler development.
```
dcosdev operator add java-scheduler
```

Your myservice project will now have the following folder file structure.
```
myservice
 |- svc.yml
 |- java
 |   |- scheduler
 |       |- build.gradle
 |       |- settings.gradle
 |       |- src
 |           |- /main/java/com/mesosphere/sdk/engine/scheduler/Main.java
 |- universe
     |- package.json
     |- marathon.json.mustache
     |- config.json
     |- resource.json
```

You build your custom scheduler using the following command.
```
dcosdev build java
```

**Note:** You can add further gradle java projects as peer folders to the `scheduler folder` under `java`. TBD introduce similar support for GO.


#### integration tests

Use the following command to add integration tests to your project.
```
dcosdev operator add tests
```

Your myservice project will now have the following folder file structure. Two tests will be added, `sanity` tests foldered service name deployment, `overlay` tests overlay networking. You will have to add further tests.
```
myservice
 |- svc.yml
 |- tests
 |   |- test_overlay.py
 |   |- test_sanity.py
 |   |- ...
 |
 |- universe
     |- package.json
     |- marathon.json.mustache
     |- config.json
     |- resource.json
```

You run the tests using the following command.
```
dcosdev test <dcos-url> [--dcos-username=<username>] [--dcos-password=<password>]
```

### basic service, aka marathon services

Creating a new basic service.
```
dcosdev basic new myservice
```

Your myservice project will now have the following folder file structure.
```
myservice
 |- cmd.sh
 |- universe
     |- package.json
     |- marathon.json.mustache
     |- config.json
     |- resource.json
```

### dcosdev up

You upload your service assets to the asset repository using the following command. This is the same command for operator and basic services.

```
dcosdev up
```

You will see the following output, showing you the dcos cli commands to take it from here.

```
after 1st up: dcos package repo add myservice-repo --index=0 http://minio.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9000/artifacts/myservice/myservice-repo.json

dcos package install myservice --yes

dcos package uninstall myservice

dcos package repo remove myservice-repo
```

### dcosdev release

Clone the Mesosphere Universe repo to your local file system, and create a branch.

```
git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/universe.git
cd universe
git checkout -b myservice
```

If this is the 1st release of myservice, then you will have to create the *myservice* folder, i.e. *repo/packages/M/myservice* before using the release command. If its not the 1st release check the folder number of the last release in the *myservice* folder. The release version number to use next will have to be greater then the previous one.

Change back to your *myservice* project folder.

Use the *dcosdev release ...* command to upload the release artifacts to s3, and to add a new folder with universe files to the myservice universe branch.

```
dcosdev release 0.1.0-1.0.0 0 <s3-bucket> --universe=<Path to clone of https://github.com/mesosphere/universe >
```

Change back to your local universe. Commit the changes, push the branch, and and on github create a pull request.
```
...
git push origin myservice
...
```
**Note:** If you dont have permissions to push a branch to the universe, then you will have to go the universe fork route. Do the changes in your fork and then create a pull request.
